OCR ML Practice

Basic Nnet practice.

The training dataset used in the training of this program was provided at http://ai.stanford.edu/~btaskar/ocr/ .

**** UPDATE 1/14/2018 ****
Due to bad foresight, the original implementation of a n-bit guesser doesn't fit the train -> execute pipeline as it should to be considered a neural net.
So, the project will be now guided toward a OCR based program that learns to categorize n by n pixel images and classify them as a specific letter.

Future implementations of this could include word recognition but for now i'll start it with black and white single letter OCR.
